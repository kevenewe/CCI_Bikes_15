## Summary

Overall, the Subscribers appear to be related with work as the peak hours are prior to and immediately after typical business hours. The customers are more likely to use the bikes around tourist sites, particularly parks and other open space.
It would be beneficial to see if bikes were rented and returned to the same place, or what percentage are returned where they started. It would also be beneficial to know if the number of bikes at the prime starting spots reduce, or if bikes need to be shuffled to meet demand. It would also be beneficial to know the rotation of the bikes so that the bikes can be properly maintained.
